        This interface signifies that an aggregate created by this operation should participate in SROA.
        SROA works by deconstructing an aggregate type into its elements.
        This only works if given read and write operations statically know which value within the aggregate
        they're referring to. See the `SROAReadWriteOpInterface` below for read and write operations.

        This interface should be used on read or write operations of aggregates that should be able to participate in
        SROA. Only if all uses of an aggregate are in read or write operations implementing the interface can it be
        fully replaced.

        This interface makes use of two `OpVariable`s to ease definition. `SROAAggregate` must be attached to one
        operand which is the aggregate that is being read from or written to. When SROA checks if all uses are
        read and write ops it makes sure that these uses are the aggregate operand of read write ops.

        Additionally, one may optionally add `SROAKey` to at max one operand. The key is an operand which is used to
        find out the precise value that is being read from or written to within the aggregate. If the operation
        has such a key operand, it should be marked with `SROAKey`. This will then make sure that the key is statically
        known and pass it along as well.

            as the first argument to each callbacks respectively. `read`s second argument is the type of the value
            to be read. It then returns the given value.

            a null attribute if no operand was annotated as such.
